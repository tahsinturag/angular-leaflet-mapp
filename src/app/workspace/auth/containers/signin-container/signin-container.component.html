<!-- 
This is like a box (container) that holds our login form.

Think of it like this:
🎁 Box (container/ parent) 
   └── 📝 Login Form (inside the box/ child)

What's happening here?
1. [regForm]: Gives the login form its information 
   (like when you give your friend a paper to fill out)

2. (signIn): Listens for when someone clicks "Sign In" 
   (like when your friend tells you they're done filling the form)
-->

<app-signin [regForm]="regForm" (signIn)="signIn()"></app-signin>
