<!-- Purpose: This file shows a search form on the map
     Why: We need this to let users search for places or things on the map -->

<!-- This line adds a search form to our page -->
<!-- It has two special features: -->
<!--   1. When someone searches something (searchParamEmitter), it runs the searchHandler function -->
<!--   2. When someone clicks close (close), it runs the closeModal function to hide the form -->
<app-search-form (searchParamEmitter)="searchHandler($event)" (close)="closeModal()"></app-search-form>
