<!--
  Purpose: This is a container component that shows sales results on a map
  
  What it does:
  1. Shows division and district information
  2. Displays top brands and their market share
  3. Shows detailed information about selected brands
  4. Has tabs to switch between different views
  
  How it works:
  - Gets data from parent component (like division names, brand lists)
  - Sends back user actions (like when someone clicks on districts or brands)
